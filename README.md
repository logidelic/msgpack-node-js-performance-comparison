# MessagePack Javascript/Node.js performance comparison
Performance comparison of all available Javascript &amp; Node.js MessagePack libraries

# Why?
I could not find a decent comparison of all available libraries, so I created this *very simple* script that can be executed regularly to determine the state of the art.

# How?
I generated the "random" data in `random_data.json` using a simple script `generate-random-data.js`. If someone can provide better test data, it would be appreciated.

# Results
You can find the full results of my own two trial runs in `result_xeon_e5-2630` and `result_tx2`.
